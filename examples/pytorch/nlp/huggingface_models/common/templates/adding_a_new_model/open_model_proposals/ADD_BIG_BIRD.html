<p>Adding a new model is often difficult and requires an in-depth knowledge
of the 🤗 Transformers library and ideally also of the model’s original
repository. At Hugging Face, we are trying to empower the community more
and more to add models independently.</p>
<p>The following sections explain in detail how to add BigBird
to Transformers. You will work closely with Patrick to
integrate BigBird into Transformers. By doing so, you will both gain a
theoretical and deep practical understanding of BigBird.
But more importantly, you will have made a major
open-source contribution to Transformers. Along the way, you will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>get insights into open-source best practices</p></li>
<li><p>understand the design principles of one of the most popular NLP
libraries</p></li>
<li><p>learn how to do efficiently test large NLP models</p></li>
<li><p>learn how to integrate Python utilities like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">black</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isort</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">fix-copies</span></code> into a library to always ensure clean and readable
code</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To start, let’s try to get a general overview of the Transformers
library.</p>
<div class="section" id="general-overview-of-transformers">
<h2>General overview of 🤗 Transformers<a class="headerlink" href="#general-overview-of-transformers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, you should get a general overview of 🤗 Transformers. Transformers
is a very opinionated library, so there is a chance that
you don’t agree with some of the library’s philosophies or design
choices. From our experience, however, we found that the fundamental
design choices and philosophies of the library are crucial to
efficiently scale Transformers while keeping maintenance costs at a
reasonable level.</p>
<p>A good first starting point to better understand the library is to read
the <a class="reference external" href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/philosophy.html">documentation of our philosophy</a>.
As a result of our way of working, there are some choices that we try to apply to all models:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Composition is generally favored over abstraction</p></li>
<li><p>Duplicating code is not always bad if it strongly improves the
readability or accessibility of a model</p></li>
<li><p>Model files are as self-contained as possible so that when you read
the code of a specific model, you ideally only have to look into the
respective <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">modeling_....py</span></code> file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In our opinion, the library’s code is not just a means to provide a
product, <em>e.g.</em>, the ability to use BERT for inference, but also as the
very product that we want to improve. Hence, when adding a model, the
user is not only the person that will use your model, but also everybody
that will read, try to understand, and possibly tweak your code.</p>
<p>With this in mind, let’s go a bit deeper into the general library
design.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview-of-models">
<h3>Overview of models<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To successfully add a model, it is important to understand the
interaction between your model and its config,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PreTrainedModel</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PretrainedConfig</span></code>. For
exemplary purposes, we will call the PyTorch model to be added to 🤗 Transformers
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BrandNewBert</span></code>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../../../../../../../../_images/transformers_overview.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, we do make use of inheritance in 🤗 Transformers, but we
keep the level of abstraction to an absolute minimum. There are never
more than two levels of abstraction for any model in the library.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BrandNewBertModel</span></code> inherits from
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BrandNewBertPreTrainedModel</span></code> which in
turn inherits from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PreTrainedModel</span></code> and that’s it.
As a general rule, we want to make sure
that a new model only depends on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PreTrainedModel</span></code>. The
important functionalities that are automatically provided to every new
model are
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained</span></code>, which are
used for serialization and deserialization. All
of the other important functionalities, such as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BrandNewBertModel.forward</span></code> should be
completely defined in the new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">modeling_brand_new_bert.py</span></code> module. Next,
we want to make sure that a model with a specific head layer, such as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BrandNewBertForMaskedLM</span></code> does not inherit
from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BrandNewBertModel</span></code>, but rather uses
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BrandNewBertModel</span></code> as a component that
can be called in its forward pass to keep the level of abstraction low.
Every new model requires a configuration class, called
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BrandNewBertConfig</span></code>. This configuration
is always stored as an attribute in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PreTrainedModel</span></code>, and
thus can be accessed via the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">config</span></code> attribute for all classes
inheriting from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BrandNewBertPreTrainedModel</span></code></p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># assuming that `brand_new_bert` belongs to the organization `brandy`</span>
<span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">BrandNewBertModel</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">from_pretrained</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;brandy/brand_new_bert&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">model</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">config</span>  <span class="c1"># model has access to its config</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Similar to the model, the configuration inherits basic serialization and
deserialization functionalities from
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PretrainedConfig</span></code>. Note
that the configuration and the model are always serialized into two
different formats - the model to a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pytorch_model.bin</span></code> file
and the configuration to a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">config.json</span></code> file. Calling
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained</span></code> will automatically call
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PretrainedConfig.save_pretrained</span></code>, so that both model and configuration are saved.</p>

<p>Everyone has different preferences of how to port a model so it can be
very helpful for you to take a look at summaries of how other
contributors ported models to Hugging Face. Here is a list of community
blog posts on how to port a model:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/huggingface/from-tensorflow-to-pytorch-265f40ef2a28">Porting GPT2
Model</a>

by <a class="reference external" href="https://huggingface.co/stas">Stas</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>From experience, we can tell you that the most important things to keep
in mind when adding a model are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Don’t reinvent the wheel! Most parts of the code you will add for
the new 🤗 Transformers model already exist somewhere in 🤗
Transformers. Take some time to find similar, already existing
models and tokenizers you can copy from.
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/">grep</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">rg</a> are your friends. Note
that it might very well happen that your model’s tokenizer is based
on one model implementation, and your model’s modeling code on
another one. <em>E.g.</em>, FSMT’s modeling code is based on BART, while
FSMT’s tokenizer code is based on XLM.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s more of an engineering challenge than a scientific challenge.
You should spend more time on creating an efficient debugging
environment than trying to understand all theoretical aspects of the
model in the paper.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask for help when you’re stuck! Models are the core component of 🤗
Transformers so we, at Hugging Face, are more than happy to help
you at every step to add your model. Don’t hesitate to ask if you
notice you are not making progress.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the following, we try to give you a general recipe that we found most
useful when porting a model to 🤗 Transformers.</p>
<p>The following list is a summary of everything that has to be done to add
a model and can be used by you as a To-Do List:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>[ ] (Optional) Understood theoretical aspects</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Prepared transformers dev environment</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Set up debugging environment of the original repository</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Created script that successfully runs forward pass using
original repository and checkpoint</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Successfully opened a PR and added the model skeleton to Transformers</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Successfully converted original checkpoint to Transformers
checkpoint</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Successfully ran forward pass in Transformers that gives
identical output to original checkpoint</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Finished model tests in Transformers</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Successfully added Tokenizer in Transformers</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Run end-to-end integration tests</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Finished docs</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Uploaded model weights to the hub</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] Submitted the pull request for review</p></li>
<li><p>[ ] (Optional) Added a demo notebook</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To begin with, we usually recommend to start by getting a good
theoretical understanding of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BigBird</span></code>. However, if you prefer to
understand the theoretical aspects of the model <em>on-the-job</em>, then it is
totally fine to directly dive into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BigBird</span></code>’s code-base. This
option might suit you better, if your engineering skills are better than
your theoretical skill, if you have trouble understanding
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BigBird</span></code>’s paper, or if you just enjoy programming much more than
reading scientific papers.</p>
<div class="section" id="optional-theoretical-aspects-of-bigbird">
<h3>1. (Optional) Theoretical aspects of BigBird<a class="headerlink" href="#optional-theoretical-aspects-of-bigbird" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You should take some time to read <em>BigBird’s</em> paper, if such
descriptive work exists. There might be large sections of the paper that
are difficult to understand. If this is the case, this is fine - don’t
worry! The goal is not to get a deep theoretical understanding of the
paper, but to extract the necessary information required to effectively
re-implement the model in 🤗 Transformers. That being said, you don’t
have to spend too much time on the theoretical aspects, but rather focus
on the practical ones, namely:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>What type of model is <em>BigBird</em>? BERT-like encoder-only
model? GPT2-like decoder-only model? BART-like encoder-decoder
model? Look at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">model_summary</span></code> if
you’re not familiar with the differences between those.</p></li>
<li><p>What are the applications of <em>BigBird</em>? Text
classification? Text generation? Seq2Seq tasks, <em>e.g.,</em>
summarization?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the novel feature of the model making it different from
BERT/GPT-2/BART?</p></li>
<li><p>Which of the already existing <a class="reference external" href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/#contents">🤗 Transformers
models</a> is most
similar to <em>BigBird</em>?</p></li>
<li><p>What type of tokenizer is used? A sentencepiece tokenizer? Word
piece tokenizer? Is it the same tokenizer as used for BERT or BART?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After you feel like you have gotten a good overview of the architecture
of the model, you might want to write to Patrick with any
questions you might have. This might include questions regarding the
model’s architecture, its attention layer, etc. We will be more than
happy to help you.</p>
<div class="section" id="additional-resources">
<h4>Additional resources<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-resources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Before diving into the code, here are some additional resources that might be worth taking a look at:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVPE62Gk3EM&amp;ab_channel=YannicKilcher">Yannic Kilcher’s paper summary</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8KNb5iqblE&amp;ab_channel=YannicKilcher">Yannic Kilcher’s summary of Longformer</a> - Longformer and BigBird are <strong>very</strong> similar models. Since Longformer has already been ported to 🤗 Transformers, it is useful to understand the differences between the two models</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/dsc-msit/is-google-bigbird-gonna-be-the-new-leader-in-nlp-domain-8c95cecc30f8">Blog post</a> - A relatively superficial blog post about BigBird. Might be a good starting point to understand BigBird</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="make-sure-you-ve-understood-the-fundamental-aspects-of-bigbird">
<h4>Make sure you’ve understood the fundamental aspects of BigBird<a class="headerlink" href="#make-sure-you-ve-understood-the-fundamental-aspects-of-bigbird" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Alright, now you should be ready to take a closer look into the actual code of BigBird.
You should have understood the following aspects of BigBird by now:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>BigBird provides a new attention layer for long-range sequence modelling that can be used
as a drop-in replacement for already existing architectures. This means that every transformer-based model architecture can replace its <a class="reference external" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-self-attention-2d627e33b20a">Self-attention layer</a> with BigBird’s self-attention layer.</p></li>
<li><p>BigBird’s self-attention layer is composed of three mechanisms: block sparse (local) self-attention, global self-attention, random self-attention</p></li>
<li><p>BigBird’s block sparse (local) self-attention is different from Longformer’s local self-attention. How so? Why does that matter? =&gt; Can be deployed on TPU much easier this way</p></li>
<li><p>BigBird can be implemented for both an encoder-only model <strong>and</strong>
for an encoder-decoder model, which means that we can reuse lots of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/src/transformers/models/roberta/modeling_roberta.py">code from RoBERTa</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/src/transformers/models/pegasus/modeling_pegasus.py">from PEGASUS</a> at a later stage.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If any of the mentioned aspects above are <strong>not</strong> clear to you, now is a great time to talk to Patrick.</p>

<li><p>Fork the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers">repository</a>
by clicking on the ‘Fork’ button on the repository’s page. This
creates a copy of the code under your GitHub user account.</p></li>
<li><p>Clone your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transformers</span></code> fork to your local disk, and add the base

</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You don’t need to have CUDA installed. Making the new model
work on CPU is sufficient.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>To port <em>BigBird</em>, you will also need access to its

<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone https://github.com/google-research/bigbird.git 
<span class="nb">cd</span> big_bird

</div>
<p>Now you have set up a development environment to port <em>BigBird</em>
to 🤗 Transformers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="run-a-pretrained-checkpoint-using-the-original-repository">
<h3>Run a pretrained checkpoint using the original repository<a class="headerlink" href="#run-a-pretrained-checkpoint-using-the-original-repository" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>3. Set up debugging environment</strong></p>
<p>At first, you will work on the original <em>BigBird</em> repository.
Often, the original implementation is very “researchy”. Meaning that
documentation might be lacking and the code can be difficult to
understand. But this should be exactly your motivation to reimplement
<em>BigBird</em>. At Hugging Face, one of our main goals is to <em>make
people stand on the shoulders of giants</em> which translates here very well
into taking a working model and rewriting it to make it as <strong>accessible,
user-friendly, and beautiful</strong> as possible. This is the number-one
motivation to re-implement models into 🤗 Transformers - trying to make
complex new NLP technology accessible to <strong>everybody</strong>.</p>
<p>You should start thereby by diving into the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/google-research/bigbird">original repository</a>.</p>
<p>Successfully running the official pretrained model in the original
repository is often <strong>the most difficult</strong> step. From our experience, it
is very important to spend some time getting familiar with the original
code-base. You need to figure out the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Where to find the pretrained weights?</p></li>
<li><p>How to load the pretrained weights into the corresponding model?</p></li>
<li><p>How to run the tokenizer independently from the model?</p></li>
<li><p>Trace one forward pass so that you know which classes and functions
are required for a simple forward pass. Usually, you only have to
reimplement those functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Be able to locate the important components of the model: Where is
the model’s class? Are there model sub-classes, <em>e.g.</em>,
EncoderModel, DecoderModel? Where is the self-attention layer? Are
there multiple different attention layers, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>self-attention</em>,
<em>cross-attention</em>…?</p></li>
<li><p>How can you debug the model in the original environment of the repo?
Do you have to add <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print</span></code> statements, can you work with
an interactive debugger like <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/">ipdb</a>, or should you use
an efficient IDE to debug the model, like PyCharm?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is very important that before you start the porting process, that you
can <strong>efficiently</strong> debug code in the original repository! Also,
remember that you are working with an open-source library, so do not
hesitate to open an issue, or even a pull request in the original
repository. The maintainers of this repository are most likely very
happy about someone looking into their code!</p>
<p>At this point, it is really up to you which debugging environment and
strategy you prefer to use to debug the original model. We strongly
advise against setting up a costly GPU environment, but simply work on a
CPU both when starting to dive into the original repository and also
when starting to write the 🤗 Transformers implementation of the model.
Only at the very end, when the model has already been successfully
ported to 🤗 Transformers, one should verify that the model also works as
expected on GPU.</p>
<p>In general, there are two possible debugging environments for running
the original model</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a> / <a class="reference external" href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb">google colab</a></p></li>
<li><p>Local python scripts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Jupyter notebooks have the advantage that they allow for cell-by-cell
execution which can be helpful to better split logical components from
one another and to have faster debugging cycles as intermediate results
can be stored. Also, notebooks are often easier to share with other
contributors, which might be very helpful if you want to ask the Hugging
Face team for help. If you are familiar with Jupiter notebooks, we
strongly recommend you to work with them.</p>
<p>The obvious disadvantage of Jupyther notebooks is that if you are not
used to working with them you will have to spend some time adjusting to
the new programming environment and that you might not be able to use
your known debugging tools anymore, like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ipdb</span></code>.</p>
<p><strong>4. Successfully run forward pass</strong></p>
<p>For each code-base, a good first step is always to load a <strong>small</strong>
pretrained checkpoint and to be able to reproduce a single forward pass
using a dummy integer vector of input IDs as an input. Such a script
could look something like this:</p>

<span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next, regarding the debugging strategy, there are generally a few from
which to choose from:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Decompose the original model into many small testable components and
run a forward pass on each of those for verification</p></li>
<li><p>Decompose the original model only into the original <em>tokenizer</em> and
the original <em>model</em>, run a forward pass on those, and use
intermediate print statements or breakpoints for verification</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, it is up to you which strategy to choose. Often, one or the other
is advantageous depending on the original code base.</p>
<p>If the original code-base allows you to decompose the model into smaller
sub-components, <em>e.g.</em>, if the original code-base can easily be run in
eager mode, it is usually worth the effort to do so. There are some
important advantages to taking the more difficult road in the beginning:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>at a later stage when comparing the original model to the Hugging
Face implementation, you can verify automatically for each component
individually that the corresponding component of the 🤗 Transformers
implementation matches instead of relying on visual comparison via
print statements</p></li>
<li><p>it can give you some rope to decompose the big problem of porting a
model into smaller problems of just porting individual components
and thus structure your work better</p></li>
<li><p>separating the model into logical meaningful components will help
you to get a better overview of the model’s design and thus to
better understand the model</p></li>
<li><p>at a later stage those component-by-component tests help you to
ensure that no regression occurs as you continue changing your code</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/LysandreJik/db4c948f6b4483960de5cbac598ad4ed">Lysandre’s</a>
integration checks for ELECTRA gives a nice example of how this can be
done.</p>
<p>However, if the original code-base is very complex or only allows
intermediate components to be run in a compiled mode, it might be too
time-consuming or even impossible to separate the model into smaller
testable sub-components. A good example is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tensorflow/mesh/tree/master/mesh_tensorflow">T5’s
MeshTensorFlow</a>
library which is very complex and does not offer a simple way to
decompose the model into its sub-components. For such libraries, one
often relies on verifying print statements.</p>
<p>No matter which strategy you choose, the recommended procedure is often
the same in that you should start to debug the starting layers first and
the ending layers last.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you retrieve the output, either by print
statements or sub-component functions, of the following layers in the
following order:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Retrieve the input IDs passed to the model</p></li>
<li><p>Retrieve the word embeddings</p></li>
<li><p>Retrieve the input of the first Transformer layer</p></li>
<li><p>Retrieve the output of the first Transformer layer</p></li>
<li><p>Retrieve the output of the following n - 1 Transformer layers</p></li>
<li><p>Retrieve the output of the whole BigBird Model</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Input IDs should thereby consists of an array of integers, <em>e.g.</em>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input_ids</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">[0,</span> <span class="pre">4,</span> <span class="pre">4,</span> <span class="pre">3,</span> <span class="pre">2,</span> <span class="pre">4,</span> <span class="pre">1,</span> <span class="pre">7,</span> <span class="pre">19]</span></code></p>
<p>The outputs of the following layers often consist of multi-dimensional
float arrays and can look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">[[</span>
 <span class="o">[</span>-0.1465, -0.6501,  <span class="m">0</span>.1993,  ...,  <span class="m">0</span>.1451,  <span class="m">0</span>.3430,  <span class="m">0</span>.6024<span class="o">]</span>,
 <span class="o">[</span>-0.4417, -0.5920,  <span class="m">0</span>.3450,  ..., -0.3062,  <span class="m">0</span>.6182,  <span class="m">0</span>.7132<span class="o">]</span>,
 <span class="o">[</span>-0.5009, -0.7122,  <span class="m">0</span>.4548,  ..., -0.3662,  <span class="m">0</span>.6091,  <span class="m">0</span>.7648<span class="o">]</span>,
 ...,
 <span class="o">[</span>-0.5613, -0.6332,  <span class="m">0</span>.4324,  ..., -0.3792,  <span class="m">0</span>.7372,  <span class="m">0</span>.9288<span class="o">]</span>,
 <span class="o">[</span>-0.5416, -0.6345,  <span class="m">0</span>.4180,  ..., -0.3564,  <span class="m">0</span>.6992,  <span class="m">0</span>.9191<span class="o">]</span>,
 <span class="o">[</span>-0.5334, -0.6403,  <span class="m">0</span>.4271,  ..., -0.3339,  <span class="m">0</span>.6533,  <span class="m">0</span>.8694<span class="o">]]]</span>,
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We expect that every model added to 🤗 Transformers passes a couple of
integration tests, meaning that the original model and the reimplemented
version in 🤗 Transformers have to give the exact same output up to a
precision of 0.001! Since it is normal that the exact same model written
in different libraries can give a slightly different output depending on
the library framework, we accept an error tolerance of 1e-3 (0.001). It
is not enough if the model gives nearly the same output, they have to be
the almost identical. Therefore, you will certainly compare the
intermediate outputs of the 🤗 Transformers version multiple times
against the intermediate outputs of the original implementation of
<em>BigBird</em> in which case an <strong>efficient</strong> debugging environment
of the original repository is absolutely important. Here is some advice
to make your debugging environment as efficient as possible.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Find the best way of debugging intermediate results. Is the original
repository written in PyTorch? Then you should probably take the
time to write a longer script that decomposes the original model
into smaller sub-components to retrieve intermediate values. Is the
original repository written in Tensorflow 1? Then you might have to
rely on TensorFlow print operations like
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/print">tf.print</a> to
output intermediate values. Is the original repository written in
Jax? Then make sure that the model is <strong>not jitted</strong> when running
the forward pass, <em>e.g.</em>, check-out <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/google/jax/issues/196">this
link</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the smallest pretrained checkpoint you can find. The smaller the
checkpoint, the faster your debug cycle becomes. It is not efficient
if your pretrained model is so big that your forward pass takes more
than 10 seconds. In case only very large checkpoints are available,
it might make more sense to create a dummy model in the new
environment with randomly initialized weights and save those weights
for comparison with the 🤗 Transformers version of your model</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you are using the easiest way of calling a forward pass in
the original repository. Ideally, you want to find the function in
the original repository that <strong>only</strong> calls a single forward pass,
<em>i.e.</em> that is often called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">predict</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">evaluate</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">forward</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__call__</span></code>. You don’t want to debug a function that calls <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">forward</span></code>
multiple times, <em>e.g.</em>, to generate text, like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">autoregressive_sample</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">generate</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to separate the tokenization from the model’s
forward pass. If the original repository shows
examples where you have to input a string, then try to find out
where in the forward call the string input is changed to input ids
and start from this point. This might mean that you have to possibly
write a small script yourself or change the original code so that
you can directly input the ids instead of an input string.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that the model in your debugging setup is <strong>not</strong> in
training mode, which often causes the model to yield random outputs
due to multiple dropout layers in the model. Make sure that the
forward pass in your debugging environment is <strong>deterministic</strong> so
that the dropout layers are not used. Or use
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transformers.file_utils.set_seed</span></code> if the old and new
implementations are in the same framework.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>BigBird has multiple pretrained checkpoints that should eventually all be ported to

<div class="section" id="port-bigbird-to-transformers">
<h3>Port BigBird to 🤗 Transformers<a class="headerlink" href="#port-bigbird-to-transformers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Next, you can finally start adding new code to 🤗 Transformers. Go into
the clone of your 🤗 Transformers’ fork:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">cd</span> <span class="n">transformers</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the special case that you are adding a model whose architecture
exactly matches the model architecture of an existing model you only
have to add a conversion script as described in <a class="reference external" href="#write-a-conversion-script">this
section</a>. In this case, you can just re-use
the whole model architecture of the already existing model.</p>
<p>Otherwise, let’s start generating a new model with the amazing
Cookiecutter!</p>
<p><strong>Use the Cookiecutter to automatically generate the model’s code</strong></p>
<p>To begin with head over to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/templates/adding_a_new_model">🤗 Transformers
templates</a>
to make use of our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cookiecutter</span></code> implementation to automatically
generate all the relevant files for your model. Again, we recommend only
adding the PyTorch version of the model at first. Make sure you follow
the instructions of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code> on the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/templates/adding_a_new_model">🤗 Transformers
templates</a>
carefully.
Since you will first implement the Encoder-only/RoBERTa-like version of BigBird you should
select the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">is_encoder_decoder_model</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">False</span></code> option in the cookiecutter. Also, it is recommended
that you implement the model only in PyTorch in the beginning and select “Standalone” as the
tokenizer type for now.</p>
<p><strong>Open a Pull Request on the main huggingface/transformers repo</strong></p>
<p>Before starting to adapt the automatically generated code, now is the
time to open a “Work in progress (WIP)” pull request, <em>e.g.</em>, “[WIP]
Add <em>BigBird</em>”, in 🤗 Transformers so that you and the Hugging
Face team can work side-by-side on integrating the model into 🤗
Transformers.</p>
<p>You should do the following:</p>

<p>In general, all questions you might have regarding the model or your
implementation should be asked in your PR and discussed/solved in the
PR. This way, Patrick will always be notified when you are
committing new code or if you have a question. It is often very helpful
to point Patrick to your added code so that the Hugging
Face team can efficiently understand your problem or question.</p>
<p>To do so, you can go to the “Files changed” tab where you see all of
your changes, go to a line regarding which you want to ask a question,
and click on the “+” symbol to add a comment. Whenever a question or
problem has been solved, you can click on the “Resolve” button of the
created comment.</p>
<p>In the same way, Patrick will open comments when reviewing
your code. We recommend asking most questions on GitHub on your PR. For
some very general questions that are not very useful for the public,
feel free to ping Patrick by Slack or email.</p>
<p><strong>5. Adapt the generated models code for BigBird</strong></p>
<p>At first, we will focus only on the model itself and not care about the
tokenizer. All the relevant code should be found in the generated files
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/transformers/models/big_bird/modeling_big_bird.py</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/transformers/models/big_bird/configuration_big_bird.py</span></code>.</p>
<p>Now you can finally start coding :). The generated code in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/transformers/models/big_bird/modeling_big_bird.py</span></code> will
either have the same architecture as BERT if it’s an encoder-only model
or BART if it’s an encoder-decoder model. At this point, you should
remind yourself what you’ve learned in the beginning about the
theoretical aspects of the model: <em>How is the model different from BERT
or BART?</em>”. Implement those changes which often means to change the
<em>self-attention</em> layer, the order of the normalization layer, etc…
Again, it is often useful to look at the similar architecture of already
existing models in Transformers to get a better feeling of how your
model should be implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that at this point, you don’t have to be very sure that your
code is fully correct or clean. Rather, it is advised to add a first
<em>unclean</em>, copy-pasted version of the original code to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/transformers/models/big_bird/modeling_big_bird.py</span></code>
until you feel like all the necessary code is added. From our
experience, it is much more efficient to quickly add a first version of
the required code and improve/correct the code iteratively with the
conversion script as described in the next section. The only thing that
has to work at this point is that you can instantiate the 🤗 Transformers
implementation of <em>BigBird</em>, <em>i.e.</em> the following command
should work:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">transformers</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">BigBirdModel</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">BigBirdConfig</span>
<span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">BigBirdModel</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">BigBirdConfig</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above command will create a model according to the default
parameters as defined in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BigBirdConfig()</span></code> with random weights,
thus making sure that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init()</span></code> methods of all components works.</p>
<p>Note that for BigBird you have to change the attention layer. BigBird’s attention
layer is quite complex as you can see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/google-research/bigbird/blob/103a3345f94bf6364749b51189ed93024ca5ef26/bigbird/core/attention.py#L560">here</a>. Don’t
feel discouraged by this! In a first step you should simply make sure that
the layer <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BigBirdAttention</span></code> has the correct weights as can be found in the
pretrained checkpoints. This means that you have to make sure that in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__init__(self,</span> <span class="pre">...)</span></code> function of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BigBirdAttention</span></code>, all submodules include all
necessary <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nn.Module</span></code> layers. Only at a later stage do we need to fully rewrite
the complex attention function.</p>
<p><strong>6. Write a conversion script</strong></p>
<p>Next, you should write a conversion script that lets you convert the
checkpoint you used to debug <em>BigBird</em> in the original
repository to a checkpoint compatible with your just created 🤗
Transformers implementation of <em>BigBird</em>. It is not advised to
write the conversion script from scratch, but rather to look through
already existing conversion scripts in 🤗 Transformers for one that has
been used to convert a similar model that was written in the same
framework as <em>BigBird</em>. Usually, it is enough to copy an
already existing conversion script and slightly adapt it for your use
case. Don’t hesitate to ask Patrick to point you to a
similar already existing conversion script for your model.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A good starting point to convert the original TF BigBird implementation to the PT Hugging Face implementation is probably BERT’s conversion script
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/7acfa95afb8194f8f9c1f4d2c6028224dbed35a2/src/transformers/models/bert/modeling_bert.py#L91">here</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can copy paste the conversion function into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">modeling_big_bird.py</span></code> and then adapt it
to your needs.</p>
<p>In the following, we’ll quickly explain how PyTorch models store layer
weights and define layer names. In PyTorch, the name of a layer is
defined by the name of the class attribute you give the layer. Let’s
define a dummy model in PyTorch, called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SimpleModel</span></code> as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">torch.nn</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">nn</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">SimpleModel</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">nn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Module</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="nb">super</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">()</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dense</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">nn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Linear</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">intermediate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">nn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Linear</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">layer_norm</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">nn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">LayerNorm</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now we can create an instance of this model definition which will fill
all weights: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dense</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">intermediate</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">layer_norm</span></code> with random weights.
We can print the model to see its architecture</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">SimpleModel</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">model</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will print out the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>SimpleModel<span class="o">(</span>
  <span class="o">(</span>dense<span class="o">)</span>: Linear<span class="o">(</span><span class="nv">in_features</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">10</span>, <span class="nv">out_features</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">10</span>, <span class="nv">bias</span><span class="o">=</span>True<span class="o">)</span>

<span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can see that the layer names are defined by the name of the class
attribute in PyTorch. You can print out the weight values of a specific
layer:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">model</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dense</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">weight</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>to see that the weights were randomly initialized</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the conversion script, you should fill those randomly initialized
weights with the exact weights of the corresponding layer in the
checkpoint. <em>E.g.</em>,</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># retrieve matching layer weights, e.g. by </span>
<span class="c1"># recursive algorithm</span>
<span class="n">layer_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;dense&quot;</span>
<span class="n">pretrained_weight</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">array_of_dense_layer</span>

<span class="n">model_pointer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">getattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">model</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;dense&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">model_pointer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">weight</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">torch</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">from_numpy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pretrained_weight</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>While doing so, you must verify that each randomly initialized weight of
your PyTorch model and its corresponding pretrained checkpoint weight
exactly match in both <strong>shape and name</strong>. To do so, it is <strong>necessary</strong>
to add assert statements for the shape and print out the names of the
checkpoints weights. <em>E.g.</em>, you should add statements like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">assert</span> <span class="p">(</span>
     <span class="n">model_pointer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">weight</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shape</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">pretrained_weight</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">shape</span>
<span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;Pointer shape of random weight {model_pointer.shape} and array shape of checkpoint weight {pretrained_weight.shape} mismatched&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Besides, you should also print out the names of both weights to make
sure they match, <em>e.g.</em>,</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">logger</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">info</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;Initialize PyTorch weight {layer_name} from {pretrained_weight.name}&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If either the shape or the name doesn’t match, you probably assigned
the wrong checkpoint weight to a randomly initialized layer of the 🤗
Transformers implementation.</p>
<p>An incorrect shape is most likely due to an incorrect setting of the
config parameters in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BigBirdConfig()</span></code> that do not exactly match
those that were used for the checkpoint you want to convert. However, it
could also be that PyTorch’s implementation of a layer requires the
weight to be transposed beforehand.</p>
<p>Finally, you should also check that <strong>all</strong> required weights are
initialized and print out all checkpoint weights that were not used for
initialization to make sure the model is correctly converted. It is
completely normal, that the conversion trials fail with either a wrong
shape statement or wrong name assignment. This is most likely because
either you used incorrect parameters in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BigBirdConfig()</span></code>, have a
wrong architecture in the 🤗 Transformers implementation, you have a bug
in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init()</span></code> functions of one of the components of the 🤗 Transformers
implementation or you need to transpose one of the checkpoint weights.</p>
<p>This step should be iterated with the previous step until all weights of
the checkpoint are correctly loaded in the Transformers model. Having
correctly loaded the checkpoint into the 🤗 Transformers implementation,
you can then save the model under a folder of your choice
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/path/to/converted/checkpoint/folder</span></code> that should then contain both a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pytorch_model.bin</span></code> file and a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">config.json</span></code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">model</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save_pretrained</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/path/to/converted/checkpoint/folder&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>7. Implement the forward pass</strong></p>
<p>Having managed to correctly load the pretrained weights into the 🤗
Transformers implementation, you should now make sure that the forward
pass is correctly implemented. In <a class="reference external" href="#run-a-pretrained-checkpoint-using-the-original-repository">Get familiar with the original
repository</a>,
you have already created a script that runs a forward pass of the model
using the original repository. Now you should write an analogous script
using the 🤗 Transformers implementation instead of the original one. It
should look as follows:</p>
<p>[Here the model name might have to be adapted, <em>e.g.</em>, maybe BigBirdForConditionalGeneration instead of BigBirdModel]</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">BigBirdModel</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">from_pretrained</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/path/to/converted/checkpoint/folder&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">input_ids</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">model</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input_ids</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">last_hidden_states</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is very likely that the 🤗 Transformers implementation and the
original model implementation don’t give the exact same output the very
first time or that the forward pass throws an error. Don’t be
disappointed - it’s expected! First, you should make sure that the
forward pass doesn’t throw any errors. It often happens that the wrong
dimensions are used leading to a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;Dimensionality</span> <span class="pre">mismatch&quot;</span></code>
error or that the wrong data type object is used, <em>e.g.</em>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">torch.long</span></code>
instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">torch.float32</span></code>. Don’t hesitate to ask Patrick
for help, if you don’t manage to solve certain errors.</p>
<p>The final part to make sure the 🤗 Transformers implementation works
correctly is to ensure that the outputs are equivalent to a precision of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1e-3</span></code>. First, you should ensure that the output shapes are identical,
<em>i.e.</em> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">outputs.shape</span></code> should yield the same value for the script of the
🤗 Transformers implementation and the original implementation. Next, you
should make sure that the output values are identical as well. This one
of the most difficult parts of adding a new model. Common mistakes why
the outputs are not identical are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Some layers were not added, <em>i.e.</em> an activation layer
was not added, or the residual connection was forgotten</p></li>
<li><p>The word embedding matrix was not tied</p></li>
<li><p>The wrong positional embeddings are used because the original
implementation uses on offset</p></li>
<li><p>Dropout is applied during the forward pass. To fix this make sure
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">model.training</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">False</span></code> and that no dropout layer is
falsely activated during the forward pass, <em>i.e.</em> pass
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">self.training</span></code> to <a class="reference external" href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.functional.html?highlight=dropout#torch.nn.functional.dropout">PyTorch’s functional
dropout</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to fix the problem is usually to look at the forward pass
of the original implementation and the 🤗 Transformers implementation
side-by-side and check if there are any differences. Ideally, you should
debug/print out intermediate outputs of both implementations of the
forward pass to find the exact position in the network where the 🤗
Transformers implementation shows a different output than the original
implementation. First, make sure that the hard-coded <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input_ids</span></code> in both
scripts are identical. Next, verify that the outputs of the first
transformation of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input_ids</span></code> (usually the word embeddings) are
identical. And then work your way up to the very last layer of the
network. At some point, you will notice a difference between the two
implementations, which should point you to the bug in the 🤗 Transformers
implementation. From our experience, a simple and efficient way is to
add many print statements in both the original implementation and 🤗
Transformers implementation, at the same positions in the network
respectively, and to successively remove print statements showing the
same values for intermediate presentions.</p>
<p>When you’re confident that both implementations yield the same output,
verifying the outputs with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">torch.allclose(original_output,</span> <span class="pre">output,</span> <span class="pre">atol=1e-3)</span></code>, you’re done with
the most difficult part! Congratulations - the work left to be done
should be a cakewalk 😊.</p>
<p><strong>8. Adding all necessary model tests</strong></p>
<p>At this point, you have successfully added a new model. However, it is
very much possible that the model does not yet fully comply with the
required design. To make sure, the implementation is fully compatible
with 🤗 Transformers, all common tests should pass. The Cookiecutter
should have automatically added a test file for your model, probably
under the same <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tests/test_modeling_big_bird.py</span></code>. Run this test
file to verify that all common tests pass:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">pytest</span> <span class="n">tests</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">test_modeling_big_bird</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Having fixed all common tests, it is now crucial to ensure that all the
nice work you have done is well tested, so that</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>a)  The community can easily understand your work by looking at
specific tests of <em>BigBird</em></p></li>
<li><p>b)  Future changes to your model will not break any important
feature of the model.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At first, integration tests should be added. Those integration tests
essentially do the same as the debugging scripts you used earlier to
implement the model to 🤗 Transformers. A template of those model tests
is already added by the Cookiecutter, called
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BigBirdModelIntegrationTests</span></code> and only has to be filled out by
you. To ensure that those tests are passing, run</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">RUN_SLOW</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">pytest</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">sv</span> <span class="n">tests</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">test_modeling_big_bird</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">BigBirdModelIntegrationTests</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In case you are using Windows, you should replace <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RUN_SLOW=1</span></code> with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SET</span> <span class="pre">RUN_SLOW=1</span></code></p>
<p>Second, all features that are special to <em>BigBird</em> should be
tested additionally in a separate test under
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BigBirdModelTester</span></code>/<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BigBirdModelTest</span></code>. This part is often
forgotten but is extremely useful in two ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It helps to transfer the knowledge you have acquired during the
model addition to the community by showing how the special features
of <em>BigBird</em> should work.</p></li>
<li><p>Future contributors can quickly test changes to the model by running
those special tests.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>BigBird has quite a complex attention layer, so it is very important
to add more tests verifying the all parts of BigBird’s self-attention layer
works as expected. This means that there should be at least 3 additional tests:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><ol class="simple">
<li><p>Verify that the sparse attention works correctly</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><ol class="simple">
<li><p>Verify that the global attention works correctly</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><ol class="simple">
<li><p>Verify that the random attention works correctly</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. Implement the tokenizer</strong></p>
<p>Next, we should add the tokenizer of <em>BigBird</em>. Usually, the
tokenizer is equivalent or very similar to an already existing tokenizer
of 🤗 Transformers.</p>
<p>In the case of BigBird you should be able to just rely on an already existing tokenizer.
If not mistaken, BigBird uses the same tokenizer that was used for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BertGenerationTokenizer</span></code>,
which is based on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sentencepiece</span></code>. So you should be able to just set the config parameter
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tokenizer_class</span></code> to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BertGenerationTokenizer</span></code> without having to implement any new tokenizer.</p>
<p>It is very important to find/extract the original tokenizer file and to
manage to load this file into the 🤗 Transformers’ implementation of the
tokenizer.</p>
<p>For BigBird, the tokenizer (sentencepiece) files can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/google-research/bigbird/blob/master/bigbird/vocab/gpt2.model">here</a>, which you should be able to load
as easily as:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">transformers</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">BertGenerationTokenizer</span>
<span class="n">tokenizer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">BertGenerationTokenizer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/path/to/gpt2.model/file&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To ensure that the tokenizer works correctly, it is recommended to first
create a script in the original repository that inputs a string and
returns the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input_ids</span></code>. It could look similar to this (in pseudo-code):</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">input_str</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;This is a long example input string containing special characters .</span><span class="nv">$?</span><span class="s2">-, numbers 2872 234 12 and words.&quot;</span>
<span class="nv">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> BigBirdModel.load_pretrained_checkpoint<span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/path/to/checkpoint/&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="nv">input_ids</span> <span class="o">=</span> model.tokenize<span class="o">(</span>input_str<span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You might have to take a deeper look again into the original repository
to find the correct tokenizer function or you might even have to do
changes to your clone of the original repository to only output the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input_ids</span></code>. Having written a functional tokenization script that uses
the original repository, an analogous script for 🤗 Transformers should
be created. It should look similar to this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">transformers</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">BertGenerationTokenizer</span>
<span class="n">input_str</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;This is a long example input string containing special characters .$?-, numbers 2872 234 12 and words.&quot;</span>

<span class="n">tokenizer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">BertGenerationTokenizer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">from_pretrained</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/path/big/bird/folder&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">input_ids</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">tokenizer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">input_str</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">input_ids</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When both <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input_ids</span></code> yield the same values, as a final step a tokenizer
test file should also be added.</p>
<p>Since BigBird is most likely fully based on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BertGenerationTokenizer</span></code>,
you should only add a couple of “slow” integration tests. However, in this
case you do <strong>not</strong> need to add any <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BigBirdTokenizationTest</span></code>.</p>
<p><strong>10. Run End-to-end integration tests</strong></p>
<p>Having added the tokenizer, you should also add a couple of end-to-end
integration tests using both the model and the tokenizer to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tests/test_modeling_big_bird.py</span></code> in 🤗 Transformers. Such a test
should show on a meaningful text-to-text sample that the 🤗 Transformers
implementation works as expected. A meaningful text-to-text sample can
include, <em>e.g.</em>, a source-to-target-translation pair, an
article-to-summary pair, a question-to-answer pair, etc… If none of
the ported checkpoints has been fine-tuned on a downstream task it is
enough to simply rely on the model tests. In a final step to ensure that
the model is fully functional, it is advised that you also run all tests
on GPU. It can happen that you forgot to add some <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.to(self.device)</span></code>
statements to internal tensors of the model, which in such a test would
show in an error. In case you have no access to a GPU, the Hugging Face
team can take care of running those tests for you.</p>
<p><strong>11. Add Docstring</strong></p>
<p>Now, all the necessary functionality for <em>BigBird</em> is added -
you’re almost done! The only thing left to add is a nice docstring and
a doc page. The Cookiecutter should have added a template file called
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docs/source/model_doc/big_bird.rst</span></code> that you should fill out.
Users of your model will usually first look at this page before using
your model. Hence, the documentation must be understandable and concise.
It is very useful for the community to add some <em>Tips</em> to show how the
model should be used. Don’t hesitate to ping Patrick
regarding the docstrings.</p>
<p>Next, make sure that the docstring added to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">src/transformers/models/big_bird/modeling_big_bird.py</span></code> is
correct and included all necessary inputs and outputs. It is always to
good to remind oneself that documentation should be treated at least as
carefully as the code in 🤗 Transformers since the documentation is
usually the first contact point of the community with the model.</p>
<p><strong>Code refactor</strong></p>
<p>Great, now you have added all the necessary code for <em>BigBird</em>.
At this point, you should correct some potential incorrect code style by
running:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make style
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and verify that your coding style passes the quality check:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make quality
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There are a couple of other very strict design tests in 🤗 Transformers
that might still be failing, which shows up in the tests of your pull
request. This is often because of some missing information in the
docstring or some incorrect naming. Patrick will surely
help you if you’re stuck here.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is always a good idea to refactor one’s code after having
ensured that the code works correctly. With all tests passing, now it’s
a good time to go over the added code again and do some refactoring.</p>
<p>You have now finished the coding part, congratulation! 🎉 You are
Awesome! 😎</p>
<p><strong>12. Upload the models to the model hub</strong></p>
<p>In this final part, you should convert and upload all checkpoints to the
model hub and add a model card for each uploaded model checkpoint. You
should work alongside Patrick here to decide on a fitting
name for each checkpoint and to get the required access rights to be
able to upload the model under the author’s organization of
<em>BigBird</em>.</p>
<p>It is worth spending some time to create fitting model cards for each
checkpoint. The model cards should highlight the specific
characteristics of this particular checkpoint, <em>e.g.</em>, On which dataset
was the checkpoint pretrained/fine-tuned on? On what down-stream task
should the model be used? And also include some code on how to correctly
use the model.</p>
<p><strong>13. (Optional) Add notebook</strong></p>
<p>It is very helpful to add a notebook that showcases in-detail how
<em>BigBird</em> can be used for inference and/or fine-tuned on a
downstream task. This is not mandatory to merge your PR, but very useful
for the community.</p>
<p><strong>14. Submit your finished PR</strong></p>
<p>You’re done programming now and can move to the last step, which is
getting your PR merged into master. Usually, Patrick
should have helped you already at this point, but it is worth taking
some time to give your finished PR a nice description and eventually add
comments to your code, if you want to point out certain design choices
to your reviewer.</p>
